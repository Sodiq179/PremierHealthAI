# Diagnosis Report:

# Symptom statement: The symptoms mentioned by the patient are a headache, sore throat, and cough

# Diagnosis: Mild respiratory infection

# History of Presenting Illness: The patient has been using panadol but there seems to be no change

# Initial treatment: 
# - Panadol
# Medications (Prescribed):
# [Continue] Panadol
# [Added] Acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin) | Pain and Fever Relievers:
#    - These over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains associated with respiratory infections.
# [Added] Pseudoephedrine (e.g., Sudafed) or phenylephrine (e.g., Sudafed PE) | Decongestants:
#    - Decongestants can provide temporary relief from nasal congestion, but they should be used cautiously and for a short duration.
# [Added] Loratadine (e.g., Claritin) or cetirizine (e.g., Zyrtec) | Antihistamines:
#    - Antihistamines may help with symptoms like sneezing and runny nose, particularly if allergies contribute to your symptoms.

# Specific Advice for the Patient:
# - Do not give the child sugary drinks, herbal tea, or coffee.
# - Food should be processed and mashed. Maintain regular daily meals: encourage eating more if the child wants to, and eat frequently in small amounts, with meals spaced 3-4 hours apart (6 meals a day). Avoid diluting food. Avoid too many fibrous fruits and vegetables and foods with excessive sugar.
# - Seek medical attention if there are symptoms: continuous watery stools, recurring vomiting, excessive thirst, poor appetite, refusing to eat or breastfeed, no improvement after 2 days of treatment, high fever, blood in stool.
